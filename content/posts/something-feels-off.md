I met a girl. We clicked in person.  
A long walk, dinner, easy conversation.  
Two, maybe three hours.  
I was unusually expressive.  
It stayed with me.

**“And then?”**

We moved to chat.  
Slow replies. Gaps. Scattered messages.  
Not cold, but no rhythm.  
Nothing rude. Still, I felt irritated.

**“Irritated by what?”**

Hard to explain.  
I don’t need constant texting.  
Gaps are acceptable, even natural.  
But each reply felt like effort without real momentum.

**“Did she do anything wrong?”**

No. That’s what confused me.  
She was consistent, in her own way.  
Asynchronous. Drop-in, drop-out.  
It worked for her.

**“So why the frustration?”**

I was still putting in mental effort.  
Reading into pauses.  
Adjusting how much I shared.  
Wondering whether to lean in or pull back.  
The conversation stayed flat, but my attention didn’t.

**“So what did you do?”**

I deleted the chats.

**“Why?”**

To conclude.  
To stop thinking.

**“About what?”**

About whether this was going somewhere.  
About whether I was overreacting.  
About what the delays meant.

**“Did it work?”**

Yes.  
Until she texted, “Who’s ghosting now?”  
I replied.  
Over-explained.  
Then apologized, for expecting.

**“What was her stance?”**

She replied when she could.  
She wasn’t looking to date.  
She was open to hanging out.

**“And how did you take it?”**

With relief.  
From clarity.

**“And then it got better?”**

No.  
It stayed the same.  
Chats still felt draining, even platonically.

**“Wasn’t that enough to step back?”**

Yes.  
Losing desire is reason enough.  
No one always needs to be at fault.

**“So why the guilt?”**

Due to lack of a clean reason.  
Nothing was “wrong enough”

**“So what brought clarity?”**

Realizing the problem wasn’t her behavior.  
It was how much energy I was spending on something that wasn’t moving.

**“Then why was it hard to act on?”**

Because part of me wanted to leave room for doubt.

**“About what?”**

That things might get better.

**“But the reality?”**

Different.

**“So why the inaction?”**

Fear of closing something too early.

**“What resolved it?”**

Realizing I wasn’t judging her.  
I was deciding for myself.

**“Which was?”**

To not invest in conversations that don’t compound.

**“But the vibe?”**

It was real.  
It just didn’t carry forward.  
The context changed and with it, the connection.

**“So going ahead?”**

I stay polite.  
I don’t initiate or carry the momentum alone.  
I reply when it feels natural.

**“Lessons learned?”**

Ambiguity drains me.  
Clarity restores my integrity.

**“And the confusion?”**

Gone.
