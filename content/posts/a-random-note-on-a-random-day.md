Got a bunch of draft thoughts that still need structure before they turn into a proper post, but I don’t have time for that right now.

So, for the sake of posting _something_ in March of 2025, here’s a low-effort copy-paste of the only entry I made today, technically yesterday. 

Also fully aware this isn’t GPT-formatted, or even remotely optimized for readability. Some parts might be confusing without the usual context I write about, but let’s assume the readers (if there even _are_ any) can AI-format it themselves this time, hehe

11:17 pm

I notice I've been writing very less recently 

Due to the dsa coding grind

Anyways i saw this movie 
Prisoners 2013

One thing just randomly popped in my head is,
Actually its not random im chatting with chatgpt for survival situation 

```

I have this impression that people are nice and we dont really need police in world so we should spend tax payer money in education n disband all police force and promote peace

Prove how wrong i am with historic examples maybe


-

Do civilizations or big cities must need police to stay civilized whatll happen if police are gone for a week hypotheically step by step timeline
With no outside influence for the city


-

Lets say that that at day 30 we remove ignoring outside influence and now the nation the city is part of gets to know the situation
Timeline of their response and actions


-

Focus more on day 30 to day 40

Detail out how the initial contsct happens and how worse can it gets and what happens

The city is fragmented like you said with local mob groups. Some are criminal controlled. Some the civilian mobs started with good intent in beginning at day 0


-

In a zombie movie it is shown very adventuruous
But i doubt that.
What would be the reality


-

Why movies portray different reality then.
I think the reality would be more harsh no zombie movie fan would want to be part of

Rapes. Food scarcity . Infections. Diseases. Violance. Trust fragmentation

-

As someone who knows this reality and he gets into such scenerio. What things he should do the majority wont do. Eg one of them would be taking diff actions (what they will be) knowing he has to play long game and that antibiotics will be more helpful then food etc

```

Anyways so yeah, when watching the movie i was very certain i won't be abducting the guy and torture him.
But if we see, that's what really helped him get to the girls

The movie portrays cleverly that the law reached there too. But law doesn't always have such good and more importantly so curious and motivated officers like one in movie.

But i also felt the father was going paranoid too. Saying theyre together in this not coz he knows but hes basing reality on his previous assumptions 

In this case he was right but thats just coincidence

Maybe he did right..
Maybe he shouldn't have tortured so much. But he had reasons. He had heard what that guy had said in his ears.
Maybe i wont do it
Coz maybe i don't have the guts and I'll just hide behind name of its not right 
Like the other black guy

Hmm

Anyways one more thing 

That girl.
She's very pretty

Like in a normal pretty way.

I mean not pretty like the standard definition of attractiveness like symmetry n all
But from definition of what one seeks

So there's this movie demons
Hindi movie with only 3-4 characters .
In the end husband kills his wife with a bucket. She literally had sex with her office friend, in the couples own home and he kind of saw all that happening in night

Good movie although i only watched its summary.
You'd start feeling bad for the guy after that scene but overall i stayed neutral. Not biased with anyone. against the comments which mostly were like, "the end was satisfying"

Coz the guy is unaware of the game
It's been time i learned about the game, the intergender dynamics, but it reveals its presense in my mind when i see these situations 

Previously i'd have made my mind that that's how women are bla bla

But now i can see through it.

The guy wasnt very good.
The marriage was not good.
The guy didn't respect her femininity

Nor she saw any masculinity from the guy
Ive to watch the movie, and listen to their dialogs fully to get affirm this but i see this was the overall dynamic

He insults her in front of the prostitute , whos very pretty by the way, will talk more about her below
But yeah, the guy is equally responsible for this situation 

He's responsible for not checking partner compatibility before marriage
He's responsible for not being aware of intergender dynamics and what his wife is craving 
He's responsible for his failure to be the man in the relationship.
Something inside says to me to make him the victim and spare him of the blame coz even 2 years ago i was unaware of all this. And nobody teaches us all this
But no. We cant offload our fault to society's fault for not reaching us this
That's outsourcing responsibility 
And not a good path to walk, not a good attitude to adopt.
However victim one looks, hes equally responsible for the situation 
His karma. In this life and in proceeding ones.

So yeah. I wont say the women deserved it and won't say what she did was right and that she had the right to fuck someone else coz her husband wasn't pampering her.

It's her own karma as well to be honest. She chose the guy to marry.
What rationale she must have chosen for that.
Money? Power? Parental pressure (again, no victimization)
But her choices led her here.
Women have this unfair looking advantage tho.
They get the attraction. Always.
They have people willing to have sex with them
The guys dont have this freedom
But guys have the advantage that they get to choose if they want to be her long term partner 
They have the power to choose and women used to use or offer intimacy to try to win that 
Yes women are hypergamist but even a women in village, poor, would still need to depend on a guy 
Modern feminism has made it even more easier for women
They dont "need" men in traditional sense
They dont need the men's commitment cuz their needs are fulfilled by society at large now

Police. Healthcare. Etc etc
And since they earn they get access to these.
The man's position has been replaced by money

For men. Women are being replaced by access to free porn etc
Like the book says, there's strong oppostion and zero progress on male contraceptives 
There's no male pills are there
Coz it'll shift the power towards men

But still the replacement for males is nowhere as powerful as one for the women

Interesting discussion. Umm. thoughts. 

I like it.

#PonderThis 

So again the prostitute girl in the movie.
Well dressed. Pretty. Calm. Etc

I just dont know the right place to look for them sheehh.

Anyways 
She has cute pics in her instagram as well

Some thought came to my mind, speculating her dating life that

One more reason for people to get into a relationship is that, whom are they waiting for really.

For actress like her. Whos struggling to be honest. She likely knows her place and her worth in the industry

Its more likely that she'll get into relationship with someone then wait for the perfect one.
And one big reason for this is her realization of her own pace of slow or stunted growth which makes the ideal further more distant coz its based on the assumption that she's reaching towards him primarily not waiting for him to find her.

Which is my own ideology really.
And i see growth and i know my further untapped potential which gives me courage to hold on, wait.

But for her. Shes very likely to not have such patience and whom is she really "saving" herself for.

I remember once (REDACTED) saying to me that her friends telling her what she thinks really that the guy who she'll get married with will have no past no sex. The guys are having multiple sex partners etc.
Basically she was validating herself, trying to feel better by dragging the "purity" wrong word but, "purity" of other person to her level to feel good

Everyone cheats, so i can too. Or . Thats theres nothing wrong if i do.
Kind of thought stream

A weak argument really if i see it well

So i was saying the girl
Cute girl with the black mole on her near the chin

Anyways
So ha.
The girl. The actress.

She'll get into a relationship with someone.
Not really worrying how she'll handle the stress of their relationship if she becomes a superstar later 

For me that's not the case coz i "know" im destined for greatness so i dont get into relationships i feel would break with the growing gap

Maybe she'll wrap all that under "who thinks so much"
But I'd just leave such conversation and prefer to stick to my point coz im different ok. Whatever you call me. I have some different opinions and its fine if i want to preserve them for my own good.

So this question really stands really. That maybe shes right living in the moment

Maybe i can do the same and later say, see we had different circumstances that time and different now.
And that i think its time we part ways coz i dont feel any feeling towards you anymore

Even thats a guilt free pass of living in the moment no.

But whats the flaw in that reasoning then.
Hmm

There wont dont really care how the other person will react cuz its their own concern right?
Then maybe you'll develop a fear that someone might also abandon you as easily as you did, when you'll be attached. So you'll develop fear of attachment i guess.
Or never commit. Its like the virus of broken hearts then.

There will be consequences. Coz it's not the right way however practical rational and in the moment it looks.

So whats the catch. 

I think the catch is in not setting up the terms correctly 
If its already defined that they're not looking for a long committed relationship. I mean it won't be friends with benefits n stuff but there's no guarentees.
If it's explicitly agreed upon that there will be no bond or obligation for other to spend forcefully rest of their lives with the other person and with situation it might be better for them to grow apart. Then that freedom should be given and agreed upon
If two ignorant people agree upon living together dying together and later see the reality of the world is different and start expecting the "freedom", the  they're breaking their own contract and are liable for the consequences 

Life really is a single player game with all others are NPCs

with slight difference that NPCs ie non playable characters in video games are usually less mobility, ability, freedom and power 

Things are little different in life tho.
You don't really have to agree upon to anyone else's expectations and commitments but your own to yourself 

It's all about the integrity and the fragmentation caused by waging war on yourself 

Youre wrong and responsible for commuting adultery not because the other person is hurt. Its because you went against your own promises.
And you're liable for that disintegrity

People will cry for any reason. Sometimes they'll make you the reason for their suffering too. 

Ultimately, its all about you and nothing about anyone else

The result of karma is not for hurting them bur for breaking your own promises. Creating a divide in yourself.

Good advait application 

Anyways

So the catch.
The the catch is, you can live in the moment. But dont think you'll be spared of your own actions.
Live in the moment among those consequences and then you're truly living in the moment. Not conditionally.

I think so i really lived in moment with (REDACTED) back then 
It might seem like i was concerned of the facing the potential 

Ahh i lost the flow state of writing as soon as the thought of creating the blogpost out of this note, came to my mind. Now I'm thinking sentenses and right words.
Its 12:08 am

Oh damn so i wrote for almost an hour 
Nice

Anyways 

So yeah the idea is since youre only responsible and obligated for your own actions and decisions. Try to take them with as much self awareness as possible. Not everyone can thing steps ahead or speculate how things will turn out in distant future. But they can listen to their heart and try to be as spotless as possible.
If the actress really takes the decision in lack of self awareness. Then its forgivable for her to be excused later for wanting to be with a "better" partner cuz they're available in her circle now

But if she know shes just using the guy as a short term solution to her own loneliness and longing for the ideal she doesn't see in him but sees no other option around AND if shes not open about this to the partner and keeping him in the shadow that she'll be with him forever, then that surely is something she shouldn't be spared from consequences of.


And this all started watching the recommended video "the murder of trooper hare" which came up while studying trees and graphs dsa topic
