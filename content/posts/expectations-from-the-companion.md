Companion words suits the most of all words.
So coming back to the point, even wearing makeup is also not something to frawn upon. Its the intentions and expectations.
Wanting to look good in own marriage is acceptable. But wanting the same for validation of others or for fear of judgement is.. something you can grow out of.

And all this thought process started after watching this youtube short about this heavy makeup tutorial and the positive comments which contradicts with my less popular opinion that not only she looked so so much better without makeup, but the "makeup" itself drags her looks far below the average line.

Pretty sure the video will be inaccessible sooner or later like all online content becomes

And finally, a thought came to make this a blog post as well. Not all posts should be well thought, clearly defined results of striving for perfectionism. Let me slip this one in, as is, fresh and raw, without any help from the llms to "format and optimize for readability"

And let me keep adding more to it in future, of course there can't be just one single "expectation" heh.
