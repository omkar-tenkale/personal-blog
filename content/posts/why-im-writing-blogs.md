Why I'm starting to write blogs
Since long, like years, I've hesitated to start a blog. I do maintain a diary, which suffices for me to pin down conclusions to my deepest thoughts and realisations, mostly philosophical.
And I never felt a need to expose all that publicly, not because there was something to hide, but because I didn't feel it's useful to anyone except me.

So what changed?
Things are still the same. I'm not writing to teach the readers anything. but i'm motivated by different factors now that i'll describe now.

## One. Make myself visible to the like minded.
I'm a loner, have been, since years. The peace and the focus that comes with it has provider me with tremendous internal growth and I almost never feel lonely despite being always alone.
And I think things too rationally sometimes. Without a support network or people around you who understand you, there's nothing preventing you going into depression. No one to correct you.
This is excellent when you're nurturing a new, maybe a revolutionary thought within you that really will affect you positively, coz you don't need to fend others from growing the thought.
My past, childhood experiences has never been good enough that I see the world in a positive way, and I struggle with it a lot even to this day. The fear of being judged and rejected, instilled me in the childhood still burdens me today and I do my best to nurture positive thinking.
The thing is, the strangers I think so much about, I never meet any, and those I meet don't validate my point. Still the fear likes to stay in me it seems. I've been saying all these things is because a friend circle where you feel secure, and are protected from the extremes has its own benefits that I can't think of but only experience.
But all the people I've met in life, all the friends i've tried to make, since I started trying.. aren't upto the mark.
They are surely good people and will help me in times as well. But none sadly inspires me. My ideals have been changed so much and i've been evolving at an abnormal pace since last few years, it's hard


## Two. Putting out the most polished parts of me.



This catalogue of thoughts is not something I'll go out and showcase to people, but it stands there in case someone wants to know who I am, unfiltered, and is willing to do a google search to reach here.
Because I'll be looking for people and have seen people who do this.


What are the goals?
Synthesized thoughts boasting my intellect would be a good one to begin with.

Wanna make money out of this?
Nope. Everything will be in public domain.

What will be the frequency?
As notable thoughts keep coming and as I feel they're worth sharing
