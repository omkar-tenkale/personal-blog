I recently discovered that I am an INTJ, a personality type known for being curious, independent, and strategic. This perfectly aligns with my natural inclination toward solitude, which has been both a blessing and a curse.

Being alone has allowed me to think independently, challenge my worldview, and achieve significant things without others' interference. As the saying goes, "No one told him it couldn't be done, so he did it." In solitude, I can dream big and turn those dreams into reality, driving my personal and career growth.

However, solitude has its downsides. Walking the road less traveled opens up new opportunities, but it also requires significant courage and resilience. Without the support of a social group, the excitement of adventure can quickly fade, leading to feelings of hopelessness and despair. 
There's a thin line between solitude and isolation, and it's not always easy to stay on the right side. This constant struggle with facing the truth has led me to both personal growth and moments of darkness, but that's the challenge I'm always up for.

My limited social circle also plays a part in my introverted nature. As I have grown and set higher goals in life, it has become challenging to connect with people who mostly seek hedonistic pleasures. 
I always seek deeper meanings and higher purposes in interpersonal relationships. The lack of such connections makes solitude more attractive to me.
I am often disappointed by the lack of inspiring individuals around me. While I have friends, even close ones, I find myself communicating with them only once every few months.
My rapid growth in recent years has left many of my friends and coworkers behind, leading me to the realization that I no longer need friends in the traditional sense. 
I am not interested in transactional friendships or maintaining those that hinder my personal growth.


I believe in the saying, "You become the average of the five people you spend the most time with." For me, these people are the authors of the books I read. Books have been my mentors, guiding my thoughts and shaping my worldview. Some of the most influential books in my life include:

- How to Win Friends and Influence People – Sparked my personality growth
- Autobiography of a Yogi – Set me on a spiritual path
- Bhagavad Gita – Helped me find the purpose of life
- Works by Swami Vivekananda – Motivated me towards a bigger purpose and deepened my understanding of Advaita philosophy
- No More Mr. Nice Guy – Opened my eyes to the reality of being a "mr. nice guy"
- The Game and The Rational Male – Challenged my thoughts about inter-gender relationships


In summary, I remain optimistic about friendships because I am the type of person I would like to be friends with. 
Life should have balance, and with the right people, it should become even more beautiful. 
There could indeed be a win-win situation in friendships, but until that time comes, in this solitude, I trust.
