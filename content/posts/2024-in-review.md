I’ve been feeling very low and unproductive lately, especially over the last few months. It’s been a struggle to focus on anything, and I’ve had little will or energy to get things done, unless it became absolutely necessary.

I don’t know if it’s because of repeatedly falling ill, injuries, career setbacks, the struggle to move on, lack of meaningful work, lack of short-term goals, or everything combined. 

Maybe it’s a vicious cycle, lack of meaningful work leads to low energy, and low energy makes everything feel pointless.

Still, managing to gather enough energy to avoid delaying the year in review post any further. But it probably won’t be as thoughtful, deep, or well thought out as I would’ve hoped.




The year started with my first-ever breakup. But within a couple of weeks, I convinced myself that I had moved on. Looking back at my journal entries and blog posts, that was a failed conviction.

What have I really done this year, aside from crying about the breakup and trying to fit it into my life in the healthiest way possible?


But 2024 wasn’t all bad. I did make some progress. For the first time, I set goals and surprisingly achieved most of them. I had written a few goals down on an A4 sheet and stuck them to my wall.

In no particular order, they were: Cooking, NoFap, Meditation, Gym, People, 8 AM, Books.


### 1. **Cooking**

I’ve always wanted to learn to cook, seeing it as an essential survival skill. In my one room kitchen flat, I had everything to get started, except the will to start.

But I did. I learned to cook chapati, sabji, dal, rice, and khichdi in no time.

At one point, this was the only goal I was achieving daily. However, after a few months, I stopped cooking. My office routine meant I had breakfast and lunch there, and dinner became two milk packets. Still, I’m happy with the cooking skills I’ve gained, even if I don’t cook every day. 

But hey, the goal was to learn to cook, not to cook daily!

Overall: 4/5 (Satisfied)


### 2. **NoFap**

Total disaster, except for a few weeks during my “red pill” awakening era.

Porn seems to offer the fulfillment of my emotional needs, the right kind of it. It presents a version of intimacy, giving the illusion of connection, affection, love, acceptance, and validation.

But the temporary satisfaction leaves me feeling more empty and disconnected. It’s a struggle I don’t know how to overcome, and frankly, I’m not sure it’ll change unless I have a true realization or a true companion in life.

Overall: 1/5 (Very Unsatisfied)

### 3. **Meditation**

Meditation has been a slow but steady journey. After years of wanting to get into it, I finally started meditating properly this year.

I’ve developed a real inclination to meditate now, and it’s become a part of my routine. In public spaces, I don’t hesitate to find a quiet, uncrowded spot and meditate for a while, without worrying about being observed.

The only problem is that hard flat surfaces make my legs go numb and start aching after about half an hour, and thats a struggle.

The best part is that I’ve noticed a real shift in my ability to automatically calm my mind. I can easily slip into a meditative state now, especially when listening to soulful, romantic, or contemplative music. It’s almost like the calm after an orgasm, with slow, frozen breathing and the ability to feel my heart beating.

I still don’t have a clear roadmap for meditation going forward, but it’s something I’m continuing to explore.

Overall: 4/5 (Satisfied)

### 4. **Gym**

The gym was easily the best part of 2024. I hit the top 1% percentile on the Cult app, maintained a max 34-week streak, burned 66,250 calories, and completed 263 classes of yoga and gym.

Thanks to my consistency during the months when I religiously followed the morning routine—waking up at 6 AM daily, joining a yoga class, followed by one and a half hours of gym, and finishing it up with half an hour of meditation—I saw significant benefits.

It boosted my confidence, improved my mood, and helped me automatically achieve my other goal of waking up early. Regular gym sessions gave me a good start to the day, leading to improved time management, a sense of progress, better discipline, improved self-image, and better health overall.

It set the tone for my day and gave me a huge boost in confidence, mood, and discipline. It also had a ripple effect on my other goals. I woke up earlier, felt more productive and literally built time and energy for everything else.

Gym is here to stay.

Overall: 5/5 (Very Satisfied)

### 5. **8 AM Wake-Up**

Waking up early was another goal for the year. Scheduling a yoga class at 6 AM every day and the one day subscription penalty on the Cult app helped me a lot in waking up. But with the pause on the gym and yoga classes, waking up early also fell apart.

Still, this habit will be reinstated. it’s very helpful, and doing this morning routine gives me plenty of time after office.

As I mentioned earlier, the gym has become a central factor in my achieving other goals.

Overall: 3/5 (Somewhat Satisfied)


### 6. **People**

Meeting new people was another goal, but the process felt draining. I met a lot of people this year, but I still don’t feel like I’ve found the kind of deep, selfless connections I’m looking for.

In terms of friends, I made some new "friends," but more in a helping/mentor role. It’s okay to add to others' lives, but I still haven’t met anyone who truly adds to mine.

I met and interacted with many women, but none could match my expectations or have the maturity I was hoping for.

Still, Bangalore was great. Before leaving for Hyderabad, I met and bid farewell to around 10 or so people in individual meetups. I can confidently say I have many friends in Bangalore.

Overall: 3/5 (Somewhat Satisfied)

### 7. **Books**

Books were a huge part of my year. Thanks to the gym, I was able to listen to more books while working out. I dove into a lot of Osho’s teachings and even created and uploaded 50+ offline podcast player apps for each of his discourses. That felt like a productive project.

The books I read were mostly about intergender dynamics and relationships this year, and the growth in that area has been significant. When I look back at my old self, I realize how much I’ve changed. I surely won’t be the same boyfriend I was, and it’ll be interesting to see how it goes next time.

Overall: 5/5 (Very Satisfied)


## Other Notable Things:

- Switched jobs and became part of the surcharge paying tax club.
- Went on a few trips and treks, falling more in love with solo traveling.
- Tried improving my appearance with earthen colored cargos and shirts.
- Failed at establishing a skincare routine, discontinued it, and made peace with acne causing whey protein. Muscles over acne.
- Restarted my Instagram, accepted 4 followers, and posted some content.
- Built the Nodal framework and learned a lot about scalable app architecture.


## 2025 Goals

Looking ahead, I want 2025 to be about outdoor exploration. During the last week of the year, I spent time in Hampi, and seeing couples in their late 20s with infants made me realize the limited opportunity for solo travel. These are the years of freedom, and I want to make the most of them while I can.

There’s also the ongoing challenge of wanting intimacy and love, but I hope to move past that this year so I can refocus on my bigger goals.

Some concrete goals for 2025 include:

- Meditating every day
- Finding and reading two books every month
- Publishing an app every two months
- Writing at least one blog post a month
- Doing 300+ gym sessions
- Going out every weekend
- Taking as many solo trips as possible
- Meeting new, interesting people with the guilty hope of finding a true companion
- Standardizing my food
- Standardizing my clothing and appearance
- Possibly finding a mentor or guru to guide me

Let’s see.
