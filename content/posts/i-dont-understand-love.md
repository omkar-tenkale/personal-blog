A pressing question needs to be solved.
Or it'll take me into depression with it

Love songs remind me of her.


What is love?
Baby dont hurt me, no more â™ª

Wanting to be loved?
No

My expectations from love?
..

Feels like a void, urging to be filled
like an alcoholic

Being the nice guy, i might hide my feelings

Love shouldn't hurt

It still hurts to remember

It wasn't love, or was it?

Stuck between the two

What I understand is
It shouldn't involve so much thinking and doubt
It shouldn't hurt

I feel I'm different from everyone else and thus unhappy


I believe this
>  don't look for love, if you do, you only end up disappointed. Don't worry about finding someone and ignore those people who tell you that the clock is ticking, because when it comes to you, you'll only have to be yourself.

Not like I already had social issues, experiencing cheating first hand has increased my problems.
