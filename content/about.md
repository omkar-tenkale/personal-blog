Hey, I'm Omkar, and this is where I share my thoughts. You’ll find my socials above, or feel free to explore the posts.

It’s mostly reflections on things that catch my attention, so if you enjoy thoughtful analysis, you might find it interesting.

These posts reflect what’s usually going on in my mind and what I feel is worth sharing from my journal, although I do question that sometimes.

Anyways, thanks for stopping by!
